<p>In Module 8: Memory Hierarchy and Optimization, we explore how modern computer systems organize and access memory, and how understanding the hardware allows us to write dramatically faster code. We begin at the hardware level with random access memory (RAM) and storage technologies, then examine how the principle of locality allows systems to bridge the enormous speed gap between the CPU and main memory through caching. From there, we turn to optimization: how to measure performance, what the compiler can do for us, what it cannot, and the code-level techniques a programmer can apply to make programs run faster. The module concludes with cache-aware programming, which ties the hardware and software sides together.</p>
<p>This module spans eight lessons that build on each other. Understanding RAM and locality explains why caches work; understanding caches explains why certain code patterns are fast and others are slow; and understanding optimization techniques gives you the tools to exploit that knowledge in practice.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this learning module, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the basic hardware technologies used in RAM, including the differences between SRAM and DRAM.</li>
<li>Explain the principle of locality (temporal and spatial) and identify locality in code examples.</li>
<li>Describe the organization of memory caches, including cache lines, sets, mapping schemes (direct-mapped, set-associative, fully associative), and write policies.</li>
<li>Explain when optimization matters and make informed decisions about whether performance gains justify the costs in code complexity and readability.</li>
<li>Use gcc optimization flags (<code>-O0</code> through <code>-O3</code>) effectively and understand what the compiler can and cannot optimize on its own.</li>
<li>Measure program performance using timing tools and profilers to identify bottlenecks before attempting to optimize.</li>
<li>Apply code-level optimization techniques such as reducing procedure calls, eliminating unnecessary memory accesses, and loop unrolling.</li>
<li>Write cache-friendly code by choosing data access patterns and data structure layouts that exploit spatial and temporal locality.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>You are expected to do the following tasks in order to achieve the above objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the reading listed below.</li>
