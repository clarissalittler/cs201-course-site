<p>In Module 8: Memory Hierarchy, Virtual Memory, and malloc, we will explore how modern computer systems organize, access, and manage memory. We begin at the hardware level with random access memory (RAM) and storage technologies, then examine how the principle of locality allows systems to bridge the enormous speed gap between the CPU and main memory through caching. From there, we move to virtual memory &mdash; the operating system's mechanism for giving each process its own private address space while sharing a single pool of physical memory. Finally, we study dynamic memory allocation: how <b>malloc</b> and <b>free</b> manage the heap, what happens under the hood, and how to avoid the common pitfalls that plague C programs.</p>
<p>This module spans five lessons that build on each other. Understanding RAM and locality explains why caches work; understanding caches explains why virtual memory can be fast; and understanding virtual memory explains the address space within which malloc operates. By the end, you will have a complete picture of how memory works from the transistor level up through the programmer's API.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this learning module, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the basic hardware technologies used in RAM, including the differences between SRAM and DRAM.</li>
<li>Explain the principle of locality (temporal and spatial) and identify locality in code examples.</li>
<li>Describe the organization of memory caches, including cache lines, sets, mapping schemes (direct-mapped, set-associative, fully associative), and write policies.</li>
<li>Explain how virtual memory works, including virtual and physical addresses, page tables, the TLB, and page faults.</li>
<li>Describe the purpose of demand paging and swapping, and explain how the operating system manages physical memory.</li>
<li>Use the malloc/free API correctly in C programs to allocate and deallocate heap memory.</li>
<li>Explain how malloc manages the heap internally, including free lists, block structure, and allocation strategies.</li>
<li>Identify and avoid common dynamic memory errors such as memory leaks, dangling pointers, double frees, and buffer overflows.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>You are expected to do the following tasks in order to achieve the above objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the reading listed below.</li>
<li>Read Lessons 1 through 5 and complete the embedded practice problems.</li>
<li>Compile and experiment with the provided C code examples. Pay special attention to the malloc/free examples and try running them under valgrind.</li>
<li>Take Quiz 8.</li>
<li>Review additional resources on the Module 8 Summary page.</li>
</ol>
