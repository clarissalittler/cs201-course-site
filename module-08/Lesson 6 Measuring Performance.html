<h1>Lesson 6: How to Measure Performance</h1>
<h2>How to Measure Performance</h2>
<p>In order to understand how well our optimization is working, we need to be able to measure how fast our programs are running. The textbook defines something called cycles per element (CPE) which it then uses for its optimization example. This is fine but not necessarily available outside of the book's code.</p>
<p>Most optimization tools in the industry (benchmarks, profilers, etc) use <b>CPU time</b>. CPU time is the amount of time in seconds a CPU was processing this particular program (as opposed to other programs that were also using the CPU). This is more accurate than straight clock time as it doesn't measure the times that the program was inactive.</p>
<p>In this module's lab, you can use the command <code>time</code> at the terminal to get CPU time. For example, if we want to know how much CPU time it takes to run a program called <code>report</code>, we type at the command line:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers d2l-code"><code class="language-c">time ./report </code></pre>
<p>Note that we need to use <code>./</code> to indicate where the executable is. The output will be whatever output the program produces followed by three lines:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers d2l-code"><code class="language-c">....
    real    0m6.480s
    user    0m6.448s
    sys     0m0.032s </code></pre>
<p>The first value (<code>real</code>) is the total <b>wall-clock time</b> &mdash; how long the program took from start to finish, including time spent waiting for I/O and time when other processes were using the CPU. The <code>user</code> and <code>sys</code> values break down how much <b>CPU time</b> was spent in user mode vs. kernel (system) mode. The sum of <code>user</code> + <code>sys</code> gives the total CPU time. Note that <code>real</code> can be greater than <code>user + sys</code> (if the program spent time waiting) or less (if the program used multiple CPU cores). The command is very useful for getting an overall feel for how fast your program is running but has its downside in that it doesn't say where in the code any slowdowns are. This is where using a profiler would be useful.</p>
