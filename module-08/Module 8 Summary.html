<h1>Module 8 Summary</h1>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>In this module, we looked at signals: what they are, how they are handled, and how to write signal handlers that can process signals in your program.&nbsp;We also saw several Signal Handler examples.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Signals are higher-level or software-level exceptions that processes, including the operating system, can send to other processes (or to itself). These can be 'caught' by the process through a signal handler: a function that is to be called when the signal is caught by the process.</li>
<li>A signal is sent from the operating system to one or more processes due to some system event. The event can be a run-time error, such as divide by zero, or the user typing &lt;ctrl&gt; c at a terminal. Many of the signals available are low-level events that are only handled by the operating system. Processes can send signals to other processes including to themselves.</li>
<li>You can block signals from your C code by using a series of functions for blocking signals.</li>
<li>Signal handlers are run differently than ordinary functions. There is no call located in the rest of the code to this function. They are called from outside by the operating system while the rest of the process is running</li>
</ul>
