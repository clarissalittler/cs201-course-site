<h1>Lesson 1: Build Process</h1>
<h2>The Steps Taken to Get From Source Code to Executable</h2>
<p>The following list is a brief description of the process of <b>building</b> software. The term is often used interchangeably with compiling, as in "compile and run your code", but compiling is actually a specific step on the way to getting an executable. The following is specific to C/C++ code. Note that steps 1, 2, and 3 are done on each given .c or .cpp file individually. Step 4 is done on all files together plus any included libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Preprocessing - Done by a preprocessor program, this stage takes any <b>preprocessor directives</b> (these are #include, #define and any line that starts with a '#') and processes them. For includes, the code from the given header file is included into the source file. For defines, the symbol is substituted for the given value throughout the source file.</li>
<li>Stage 2: Compiling - For each source code file, the results of the preprocessor stage are sent to a compiler that will convert it to assembly code. <b>Assembly code</b> is an intermediate language between high-level languages and low-level machine code. It was invented in the mid-20th century as a readable improvement over machine code until FORTRAN came along. We'll be discussing this language for the next few modules. <br><br>This is the stage that takes the most work for the compiler as it will do all of the optimizing in this stage as well as translating. If the process is stopped here using the -S option, a file with the assembly code ending in .s is created for each .c file. This is a text file and can be opened in a text editor.</li>
<li>Stage 3: Assembly - In this stage, an assembler takes the assembly code generated by the compiler for each file and creates 'almost' machine-level code. When you use the -c flag, <code>gcc</code> will stop after this step and write out the 'object code' it generated for each .cpp file into a .o file (object file). For those students used to doing builds with make, you are probably familiar with these files.</li>
<li>Stage 4: Linking - This stage takes all the object files created in stage 3, plus a lot of system and library code from elsewhere and combines them into an executable file. The executable is then finally pure machine-code although there may be some other information left in the file for debugging purposes (these are called <b>symbols</b>). But at this point you can execute the file as a program.</li>
</ul>
