<p>In this Module 6: Threads and Synchronization, you will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threads: what they are, how they differ from processes, and why they are a fundamental building block of concurrent programs.</li>
<li>The POSIX threads (pthreads) library: how to create, manage, and join threads in C programs.</li>
<li>Race conditions: what happens when multiple threads access shared data without coordination, and why the results are unpredictable.</li>
<li>Mutexes: the primary synchronization primitive for protecting critical sections of code.</li>
<li>Condition variables and semaphores: more advanced synchronization tools for coordinating thread activity.</li>
<li>Classic concurrency problems: the Dining Philosophers problem and the Reader-Writer problem, which illustrate the challenges of concurrent programming.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In earlier modules, you learned how to create new processes using <b>fork()</b> and how processes communicate using signals. Processes are heavyweight: each fork creates a complete copy of the address space. Threads offer a lighter-weight alternative. Multiple threads within the same process share the same address space (code, heap, global variables) but each has its own stack and set of registers. This makes threads cheaper to create and allows them to communicate through shared memory. However, shared memory introduces new problems: when multiple threads read and write the same data simultaneously, the results can be unpredictable and incorrect. This module teaches you how to write correct concurrent programs by using synchronization primitives.</p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this learning module, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the difference between threads and processes, including what is shared and what is private to each thread.</li>
<li>Create and join POSIX threads using <b>pthread_create()</b> and <b>pthread_join()</b>, passing arguments and receiving return values.</li>
<li>Identify race conditions in concurrent code and explain why they produce incorrect results.</li>
<li>Use mutexes (<b>pthread_mutex_t</b>) to protect critical sections and prevent race conditions.</li>
<li>Use condition variables (<b>pthread_cond_t</b>) and semaphores (<b>sem_t</b>) to coordinate threads that must wait for specific conditions.</li>
<li>Describe classic concurrency problems (Dining Philosophers, Reader-Writer) and implement solutions that avoid deadlock and starvation.</li>
<li>Identify and avoid common pitfalls in concurrent programming, including deadlock, starvation, and data races.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>You are expected to do the following tasks in order to achieve the above objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read Lessons 1 through 6 and study the code examples carefully. Type them in and run them yourself.</li>
<li>Compile and experiment with the provided C programs. Observe how race conditions produce different results on each run.</li>
<li>Complete Discussion 6</li>
<li>Take Quiz 6</li>
<li>Review additional resources in the Module 6 Summary</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Important:</strong> The code examples in this module require the pthreads library. When compiling, always include the <b>-lpthread</b> flag (or <b>-pthread</b>). For example: <b>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lpthread</b>
