<h1>Module 10 Summary</h1>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>In this module, you learned how to optimize your code to run faster. The primary objective in writing a program must be to make it work correctly under all possible conditions. A program that runs fast but gives incorrect results serves no useful purpose. Programmers must write clear and concise code, not only so that they can make sense of it but also so that others can read and understand the code during code reviews and when modifications are required later.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many occasions when making a program run fast is also an important consideration. When a computation task is so demanding that it requires days or weeks to execute, then making it run just 20% faster can have a significant impact.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Writing an efficient program requires several types of activities. First, we must select an appropriate set of algorithms and data structures.</li>
<li>Second, we must write source code that the compiler can effectively optimize to turn into efficient executable code. For this second part, it is important to understand the capabilities and limitations of optimizing compilers. Seemingly minor changes in how a program is written can make large differences in how well a compiler can optimize it. Some programming languages are more easily optimized than others. Some features of C, such as the ability to perform pointer arithmetic and casting, make it challenging for a compiler to optimize.</li>
<li>Programmers can often write their programs in ways that make it easier for compilers to generate efficient code. A third technique for dealing with especially demanding computations is to divide a task into portions that can be computed in parallel, on some combination of multiple cores and multiple processors. We will defer this aspect of performance enhancement to a later Chapter.</li>
