<h1>Lesson 2: Other Types of Memory</h1>
<h2>Other Types of Memory Besides RAM</h2>
<p>Other types of memory exist inside a computer system. These types mainly show up as hardware-related software and data stored inside microchips. This is not accessible by user programs but may affect how they run.</p>
<p>There are several technologies used over the years for this type of storage:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read Only Memory (ROM)</strong>&nbsp;- This is the original hardware memory. It is called 'read only' because it was hard coded into the microchip when it was manufactured and couldn't be changed. In newer technology, this isn't true anymore but the name has stuck.</li>
<li><strong>programmable ROM (PROM)</strong>&nbsp;- This was a bit better in that memory could be written to but only once. It usually was written to during manufacturing and was designed to make customized microchips.</li>
<li><strong>erasable programable ROM (EPROM)</strong>&nbsp;- Here data can be changed many times but changing it needed a special device to do so.</li>
<li><strong>electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM)</strong> - This finally became the norm for what is called&nbsp;<strong>firmware</strong>&nbsp;in that it can now be changed through software albeit this is done via the operating system.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>EEPROM is also the technology used in&nbsp;<strong>flash memory</strong>. Flash memory started out as small portable USB external drives (keychains, etc). Now flash memory is taking over internal disk drives as SSD (Solid State Drive) are becoming the norm in most computer equipment (see disk storage).</p>
