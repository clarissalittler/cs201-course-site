<h1>Lesson 3: Accessing Main Memory</h1>
<h2>Accessing Main Memory</h2>
<p>Buses carry data (and addresses) back and forth from the CPU to main memory. A <b>bus</b> is a collection of parallel wires inside the computer bundled in ribbon-like connectors. There are many of them but we will discuss just those that connect the CPU to main memory.</p>
<p><!-- [[ a picture of a bus ]] --></p>
<p>There are two buses that connect the CPU to main memory: One (<b>system bus</b>) is from the CPU to a controller device called an <b>I/O Bridge</b>. The other (<b>memory bus</b>) goes from the I/O Bridge to the main memory. An <b>I/O Bridge</b> is just a device that routes requests from the CPU to the correct location: main memory, disk drive and so on. There are other buses called I/O buses that connect peripherals with the CPU: graphics cards, monitors, mice, keyboards and external drives.</p>
<p><!-- [[ a picture of the set of main buses in a computer system ]] --></p>
<p>Whenever the CPU and main memory need to send data to each other, they set up a <b>bus transaction</b>. This is a series of steps that transfer data in one direction. A <b>read transaction</b> transfers data from main memory to the CPU; a <b>write transaction</b> transfers data from the CPU to main memory.</p>
