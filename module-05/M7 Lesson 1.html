<h1>Lesson 1: Flow Control</h1>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">NOTE: This is a summary of chapter 8, sections 8.1 to 8.4 in the textbook.</div>
<h2>Flow Control</h2>
<p>The sole job of the CPU is to process one instruction after another. Going from one instruction to another is called <b>control transfer</b>. A set of control transfers is called a <b>flow of control</b> or <b>control flow</b>.</p>
<p>Normal control flow is typically moving from one instruction to another along with any jumps. This is usually based on the '<b>state</b>' of the internal variables. Sometimes this flow control needs to be interrupted by outside events.</p>
<p>For example, a hardware timer goes off at regular intervals and must be dealt with. A program had requested data from a disk and needs to be notified that the data is ready. Parent processes that create child processes must be notified when their children terminate.</p>
<p>In these cases the operating system makes some abrupt changes to the normal flow control of the program being run. This is called <b>exceptional flow control (EFC)</b>. It is exceptional in that it would not be the normal flow control for the program if some event hadn't happened to interrupt this normal flow.</p>
