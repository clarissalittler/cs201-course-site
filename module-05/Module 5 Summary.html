<h1>Module 5 Summary</h1>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>In this module, we moved from the instruction level to the operating system level. We discussed exceptional control flow and the four classes of exceptions. We learned about processes -- how the operating system creates, schedules, and terminates them -- and practiced using <code>fork</code>, <code>exec</code>, and <code>wait</code> to create and manage child processes. Finally, we studied signals: what they are, how to write signal handlers, and how to safely block and unblock them.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sole job of the CPU is to process one instruction after another. Going from one instruction to the next is called a control transfer, and a sequence of control transfers is called the control flow. Exceptions are abrupt changes in the control flow triggered by some change in the processor's state.</li>
<li>In modern Linux systems, there are 256 possible exceptions. Numbers 0-31 are hardware exceptions defined by the architecture (Intel x86-64), and numbers 32-255 are interrupts and traps defined by the operating system.</li>
<li>A process is an instance of a program in execution. Each process has its own private address space and the illusion that it has exclusive use of the processor. The <code>fork</code> system call creates a new child process that is a copy of the parent, and the child and parent continue executing concurrently from the point of the fork.</li>
<li>The <code>fork</code> call returns twice: once in the parent (returning the child's PID) and once in the child (returning 0). Programs that use <code>fork</code> can produce different outputs on different runs because the order in which the parent and child execute is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Signals are software-level exceptions that processes can send to other processes. A signal can be caught by installing a signal handler -- a function that the operating system calls when the signal is delivered to the process. If no handler is installed, the operating system takes a default action.</li>
<li>Signal handlers run asynchronously, outside the normal flow of the program. Because of this, signal handlers must be written carefully: they should use only async-signal-safe functions, and shared data structures should be protected by blocking signals during critical sections.</li>
</ul>
