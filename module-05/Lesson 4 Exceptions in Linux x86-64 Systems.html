<h1>Lesson 4: Exceptions in Linux/x86-64 Systems</h1>
<h2>Exceptions in Linux/x86-64 Systems</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
<p>In modern Linux systems, there are 256 possible exceptions. Numbers 0-31 are hardware exceptions defined by the architecture (Intel x86-64) and numbers 32-255 are interrupts and traps defined by the operating system (Linux).</p>
<p>The 256 exceptions are too numerous to list. Here is a short list of some common exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="heading"><strong> Divide Error (0)</strong> </span> - This is classified as a fault. The kernel delivers SIGFPE, which terminates the process by default. This only works with integer arithmetic as floating point just sets the resulting value to infinity (inf) when a divide by zero is performed. Ironically, this is called a 'floating point exception' even if by default it only happens with integer math.</li>
<li><strong><span class="heading"> General Protection Fault (13)</span></strong> - This fault is triggered by segment-level protection violations such as privilege violations or certain misaligned accesses. Although the kernel delivers SIGSEGV for this exception, it is distinct from the more common Page Fault (exception 14) that produces the familiar "segmentation fault" when a program accesses invalid memory.</li>
<li><strong><span class="heading"> Page Fault (14)</span></strong> - These are pretty much recoverable so most application programmers rarely see this exception. This is when a part of memory is actually out on the disk drive instead of in main memory. A 'page' is how memory is divided.</li>
<li><span class="heading"><strong>Machine check (18)</strong> </span> - Machine check is typically what is generated when hardware fails. This is always an abort (and may cause the operating system to abort).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux System Calls</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of system calls in Linux. These are basically functions you can call within your C/C++ program to ask for services of the operating system. Typical ones are file I/O, managing processes (starting child processes or exiting the current process) and so on. Figure 8.10 in the textbook shows a table of some of these calls. We will discuss using some of these in future sections.</p>
